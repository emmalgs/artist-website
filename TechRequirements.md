# Art Website Requirements
**Emma Gerigscott**
**October 5, 2023**

## What this is 

This project will use Firebase to store and fetch images for an art website. The art website will have a paintings section, organized by year, a drawings section, with each drawing a card that when clicked displays text by the artist, and an about section that includes the artistâ€™s cv, bio, artist statement, and contact.

## Context

The purpose of this project is to display my artwork for clients and viewers to look at my art, read my writing, and learn more about my past work and contact me through an easily navigable webpage. This project is also for me to practice component design with React as well as atomic design to access the Firebase service.
