### Tech Spike: Storybook Integration

#### Purpose
The purpose of this tech spike is to explore and evaluate the integration of Storybook into our project's development workflow. Storybook is a powerful tool that allows for the isolated development and testing of React components, making it an excellent fit for our Atomic Design-based component architecture.

#### Background
- Storybook is an open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation. It provides a development environment for building, testing, and documenting components.
- Storybook supports various frameworks, including React, making it a suitable choice for our project.
- It encourages a component-driven development approach, which aligns well with our Atomic Design-based component structure.

#### Objectives
1. Evaluate the benefits of using Storybook in our project.
2. Explore the setup and integration process of Storybook with our TypeScript, React, Vite, and Firebase stack.
3. Determine how Storybook can enhance the development, testing, and documentation of our UI components.

#### Tech Spike Steps
1. **Installation**: Install Storybook in the project using npm or yarn.
  - ```npm install @storybook/builder-vite --save-dev``` or ```yarn add @storybook/builder-vite --dev```
  - Update your Storybook configuration (in .storybook/main.js|ts) to include the builder.
  
```// .storybook/main.js|ts

export default {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.mdx', '../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-links', '@storybook/addon-essentials'],
  core: {
    builder: '@storybook/builder-vite', // ðŸ‘ˆ The builder enabled here.
  },
};  
```

2. **Configuration**: Configure Storybook to work with our project's TypeScript and React setup.

3. **Create Stories**: Create stories for selected components. These stories will serve as isolated development and testing environments for components.

4. **Documentation**: Document the components using Storybook's documentation features.

5. **Interactive Development**: Use Storybook to interactively develop and test components, ensuring they function as expected.

6. **Testing**: Evaluate how Storybook can be utilized for component testing.

7. **Integration with CI/CD**: Investigate how Storybook can be integrated into our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

#### Findings and Benefits
- Storybook provides an excellent way to develop and test components in isolation, improving component quality and reusability.
- It facilitates better documentation of components, making it easier for team members to understand and use them.
- Storybook can serve as a valuable tool for showcasing design iterations and collaborating with stakeholders.
- Integration with CI/CD can automate the testing and deployment of components.

#### Recommendations
Based on the tech spike findings, it is recommended to incorporate Storybook into our project's development workflow. This will help streamline component development, testing, and documentation, ultimately enhancing the quality and maintainability of our art website.
